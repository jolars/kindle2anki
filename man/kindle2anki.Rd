\description{
This function converts and augments
a \verb{*.db} Kindle database file (usually \code{vocab.db})
to a \code{.tsv} file ready for import into Anki. It extracts the words
used and for then, for each word class (adjectives, nouns, verbs, adverbs)
scrapes the wordnet API for a set of definitions, synonyms, and usage.
Only the first usage entry is used. The result is a data table with
each word and its class, definition, synonyms, and usage. You will usually
want to call \code{\link[=listBooks]{listBooks()}} on the \code{file} first and get the Amazon ID
to use in the \code{asin} argument to this function.
